# **RustBlockchain**

This is the implementation of a core blockchain network using **Rust**. The project allows you to simulate basic blockchain functionalities such as creating new transactions, mining blocks, and adjusting blockchain parameters like difficulty and reward. The project demonstrates fundamental blockchain operations including proof-of-work, block creation, transaction management, and more.

## **Features**

- Create new transactions between a sender and a receiver.
- Mine new blocks with proof-of-work mechanism.
- Adjust mining difficulty and block reward dynamically.
- Tracks a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions.
- Implements Merkle tree to calculate the root hash of transactions.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (Rust 1.56+ is recommended)

### **Installation**

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RustBlockchain.git
cd RustBlockchain
```

Build the project:
```bash
cargo build
```

Usage:
Run the application:

```bash
cargo run
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to create transactions, mine blocks, and adjust parameters.
